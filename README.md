# Joy Editor
This is an experimental editor based on trying to make [Joy](https://ncase.me/joy/) work in a file editor metaphor.

This editor isn't available on the VS Code Marketplace, so for now you'll have to build from source if interested.

## Development

```
git clone
cd joy-editor
yarn start
# Press F5 or Run -> Start Debugging
# Open up the examples folder within the VS Code window that is launche
```
